== Description ==
WooCommerce Loyal Customers is a WordPress WooCommerce plugin developed by [The Right Software](https://therightsw.com/) web development company. It provides wp-admin a way to view the total number of orders received per registered customers in a very user friendly manner with the help of color codes. It also gives a functionality to search registered customers by name and email. Beside this, wp-admin can also sort the order count by ascending and descending order. Please note that if a registered customers posted a single order, which has status of failed or in process, It will not be accounted in our plugin. In short, order count will work fine in case of those registered customers who have posted at least one successful order.
